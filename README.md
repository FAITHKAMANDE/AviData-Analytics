# AviData-Analytics
# Description 
The Aim of this project is to analyze aviation accident data to identify low-risk aircraft for commercial and private ventures. This project focuses on data cleaning, imputation, and visualization of National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident records, enabling data-driven recommendations for expanding into the aviation industry

The dataset (provided in the Aviation_data folder) is sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident records.
It includes:
- NTSB accident data from 1962 to 2023
- Contains fields such as: date, aircraft make , model, location, and descriptions of the accidents.

## 1. Project Overview
   
Our  company is diversifying into new industries, specifically aviation, but needs clarity on potential risks associated with different aircraft.

This repository demonstrates:
- Data Cleaning & Imputation: Handling incomplete or inconsistent aviation records.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns in accidents, causes, and outcomes.
- Interactive Visualizations: Building dashboards to communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders.
- Strategic Recommendations: Advising on which aircraft to purchase based on risk profiles

## 2. Business Context
Goal: Determine which aircraft present the lowest risk, allowing your organization to invest wisely in commercial and private aviation enterprises.
Key Stakeholder:
- Decision makers in the new aviation division
- Investors seeking actionable insights for risk mitigation
- Operations and safety teams focused on improving maintenance and training protocols

## 3. Data 
The dataset (found in the Aviation_data folder) is sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and covers civil aviation accidents from 1962 to 2023, including:
- Aircraft type ,make and model
- Accident date and location
- Accident severity and contributing factors

## 4. Key Components
### Data Cleaning & Imputation
- Handling missing values
- Dealing with duplicates
- Correcting data types
- standardizing the date formarts
### Analysis & Modeling
- Summaries of accident frequency and severity
- Exploration of risk factors across different aircraft types
## Interactive Dashboards
- Visualize aggregated metrics and trends
- Enable filtering by aircraft category, or risk level
## Business Recommendations
- Highlight specific aircraft types/models with lower incident rates
- Outline strategies for safer operations and maintenance

7. Business Recommendations
- Airplanes are the best option to invest especially in commercial use.
- Helicopters could be considered for private use.
- Avoid smaller aircraft unless equipped with advanced safety features.
- Prioritize aircraft with strong safety measures during landing and takeoff.
- Ensure aircraft have modern weather detection technology.
- Consider acquiring business and executive aircraft.
- Select aircraft with high durability and safety records.
- Opt for multi-engine aircraft to enhance safety.
- Choose modern aircraft manufactured after 2010.
- Invest in training the safety protocols.
